## What am I?

Fakturoplujka is a small command line app, that allows you to generate beautiful 
invoices (in Polish format), using LaTeX

## Requirements:

You must have LaTeX and PHP installed on your system. Get LaTeX here: [The Latex Project](https://www.latex-project.org/get/)

## Usage:

Enter the appropriate data into the corresponding files in the ``config`` folder.
File structure is pretty self explanatory. There you will find a sample configuration.



To generate your invoices, just run following command:
```
php makeFV.php
```

## Have fun! ðŸ¥³
